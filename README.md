## Restart Repair Directory

The Restart Repair Directory is a tool for encouraging repair through local businesses.  
It allows for the recording of local repair businesses in a directory and the searching of this directory by 
the public.  [Find out more](https://therestartproject.org/repairdirectory/about).

This repository contains the public front end; the server and admin are in a separate repository
[here](https://github.com/TheRestartProject/RepairDirectory).  

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# If you have a dev version of the server set the API environment variable, e.g.
export API=http://restarters.test:8000/map/

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
